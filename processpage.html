    Reviews are my thoughts, feelings and impressions after being exposed to various media or merchandise. I would highly recommend you expose yourself to it and form your own thoughts before reading any of these. They may contain spoilers and my opinions good or bad, should not influence you on something. That being said things are scored as follows.


Criteria


Name: The name designation of the product entity

Overview: A few sentences or brief paragraph description of what the product entity is.

Sounds/Music: The quality of sound and the beauty of its music incorporated, or lack there of

Writing/Story: The quality of the characters, the setting and the overall plot. Things also may entice a strong literary score if the lore and or mythology of the product is rich, even if the story arcs may fail from time to time.

Graphics/Special Effects: This is a measure of how good the graphics/special effects are. Some debate some graphics/special effects scores of mine might be to high, but I tend to judge based on when the product was released, not by today’s standards.

Favorite Part(S): This is what attracts me the most to the product

Total Score: This is not an average of the above categories, this is my final judgment on the products overall strength.

Review: The part everyone comes here to see, me ranting.

Numbers

0: A null score is given out very rarely, it is for something that you just can’t say anything nice about, no matter how hard you try.

1: Pedestrian. An extremely poor execution. It scores a point, but it is clear that the minimum effort and thought was actually put into it.

2: Weak. A Weak score indicates something very poor. It might have a few things that prevent it from sinking further, but not enough to enlist it scoring higher.

3: Average. A average score is something while not bad, is not particularly great either. I tend to give this score more than anything else, as I really try to be fair.

4: Exceptional. This score indicates a very strong product. Their might be a minor flaw or two but nothing that really is detrimental in the long run.

5: Astonishing. A score of this indicates something is among the best of the best.

Additional notes. My scoring guide is arbitrary and aims to be as educative as possible. As are my comments during said review. I encourage everyone to try products and sample them for themselves and make their own decisions. These have never been intended to force my opinions on others. If something is rated low it does not mean you have to hate it, and likewise if it is rated high you are under no obligation to love it.
