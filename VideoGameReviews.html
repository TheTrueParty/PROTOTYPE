Many people dislike this one. They feel the AI is incompetent. There was a later patch to address this, but I haven't really noticed any difference before and after. 

This game is full of many interesting ideas. The tech tree is also interesting, although a quibble I have is, it is not organized in any sort of logical manner. So if you want new weapons, you have to wait until you see its corresponding group light up, theirs no way to do a logical progression of tech items you may want to upgrade.

This however is a very minor issue, as their is so many fun gadgets and things to play around with in the meantime. 

The game also suffers from that their is far too much time, waiting for one thing to be built or researched, compared to the relatively small amount of time you’ll actually spend seeing your stuff in action. This also becomes a problem when you expand your empire to include more planets. 

Economically then, you'd want each planet to have a project started before you end your turn, so as to get the most done in the least amount of time. This is not so bad early on, but late game it becomes difficult to manage every planet and if there all popping up to you with updates, or need a new task, it can become very frustrating.

Likewise, the ship building, although fun, it can be annoying at times. Thiers really nothing worse than spending 200 days on a ship that can’t even fly, lacking an important piece of hardware such as a reactor or engine.

This game does have a unique interface that does its job very well. It is a little tricky but not overwhelming, and once you play a few games, the interface becomes very smooth.

All in all though this game is very colorful, and the special use devices are definitely fun. There is a lot of strategic potetional, if you can look aside some of the more quirky elements.

If you enjoy games such as SimCity, or Master of Orion, this will be enjoyable.

Review:

If you ask people what is one of the best Computer RPGS, most will say this game. Based on first edition AD&D rulebook and placed within the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, this is forever a classic, and a prodigy. 

This game is responsible for starting a short-lived genre of video games, the Infinity Engine Era. 

The sounds are all good; the voice actors are fun to listen to. This is very much a dialogue driven game. Although combat is possible, it is very rarely necessary. There is a still lot of equipment and spells and abilities to use however should you choose to go that route. A very strong point of this game is the spell and item descriptions, rich with lore and history.

The combat system does take some getting used to for those used to fast paced games, as it is turn based in real time. In other words you decide to cast a spell, and it might take 2-3 rounds to finish the cast in the mean time they had 2-3 rounds to execute whatever move they had waiting for you. Fans of more fast paced action games will take some getting used to the fact that once they do there command, there required to watch, at least for a little bit, to see the result, before picking a new action.

The effects are not bad, but their not great. Unfortunately, that has the result of making the casters look kind of foolish.

The story writing in this game is however top notch. Without giving too much away, this chronicles the story of you leaving your childhood home with your foster father, to learn the truth about your ancestry, a journey which will take you all across a vibrant country. Many different towns and locales to visit, it truly is a big world out thier on the Sword Coast.

The level cap also is a disappointing point, for it is very low, and as such, characters level extremely slowly, and only top out at six or seven. This is perhaps the most annoying aspect of this game, and never do you truly feel powerful or a fully developed character. Likewise, many characters have little, in the way of health or even abilities.

This is a flaw that has more to due with the AD&D core ruleset used to govern things, but still it is quite annoying to have your characters die so often and so fast, or to be unable to accomplish certain quests because you simply lack the power.

The expansion pack adds new sub-quests, a few new areas, raises the level cap a few levels and adds more spells. It also tweaks some areas of the original game to give better performance.

This is not a bad game in any sort of way; it just lacks polish and might not be what most people would expect from it.

Review:


Baldur’s Gate, despite not being everything everyone hoped it would be, was still largely successful. Despite its lack of overall polish, it would inspire a new genre of video games; RPG’s based on AD&D properties, where all of the die rolls were handled by the computer, leaving the player free to focus on their character. A sequel was inevitable.

Baldur’s Gate II allows much more immersion into your character. The sounds are thankfully all better, and the voice actors sound much better this time around. 

The story is well done, and as the last game is very much dialogue driven. On that note NPC’s roles have been expanded, and will talk to each other and actually form relationships with both you and among themselves over the course of the game. There are also many new party members to find throughout your journey, and many BG1 characters show up in cameos or supporting roles.

Other improvements include using the 2nd Edition AD&D books for reference, this in turn adds more items, spells, abilities and character classes to what was already there. A very nice thing is the flaw from the first game is completely abrogated. Characters now have high-level caps, and progression between the levels is much more natural and no longer nearly as painful. On that note, combat while still not always the way to go, it is improved and there are in fact more dedicated fight scenes than its predecessor. 

A design flaw unfortunately, is the game is linear, even more so in the expansion. Where in the first game you had the main story you could do whenever you wanted to and endless sub quests, in this game there is much fewer areas. It’s hard to say if this means there’s less to do, what is there is very nice, I just feel like in taking out the free roam and having fewer clearly defined map points, you lose some of the sense freedom in the previous game. This game also restricts the availability of the bulk of sub-quests to only be able to be done during three specific intervals throughout the story line, if you opt not to do them during this point, you will lose your chance.

Considering all the other improvements this is reputedly a minor flaw but still more then a little irksome. 

The expansion of pack Throne of Bhaal, raises the level cap, introduces a new character class, the Wild Mage, new spells and high-level abilities. It also serves to conclude the story arc and is treated as the final part. 

The expansion has a flaw that is so common with these games, very linear. You play games like this or Mass Effect, and receive a big build up for the final act. It’s worth noting Mass Effect series was also created by the makers of this game. In this case, Baldurs Gate chronicled the story of a child who realizes his real father was in fact a God; in the second game you dealt with an adversary who was attempting to steal your divinity, throughout it all always knowing that one day your Father’s children would rise up and their will be an inevitable war for said God’s power. 

Finally, you get there, and then, you play it out, exactly the way they tell you to. With no twists or turns, and a complete lack of freedom, if this was not pedantic enough, you may, finally get to the point where you can assume the God’s power, and then the game ends. I really was looking forward to fighting the war how I chose to, and not being stuck on a single lane path to the endgame. I feel like that is a letdown, as if you worked so hard to get there, and then get to do nothing with it.

All in all though it’s a worthy successor and its improvements over the first entry make it one for the ages.

Somewhere along the line, many game genres become defunct and otherwise forgotten about. The price of progress I suppose. This is one game, which definitely has an old school flair to it, and yet, is very fresh and largely succeeds.

There is a very large roster of playable characters. In addition, each character is given many different costumes. These do not affect its moves or fighting ability, but it is awesome to see so many different alternate looks for each fighter. This game really goes deep into the legends, for each characters costumes and move sets. 

The game also contains many different modes, mini games, scenarios that add to the replayability factor.

The storyline while the overall plot is all right, the way it plays out in the single player campaign, feels, annoying among other things. It relies heavily on mirror battles, and although that is the overall theme of the story, you can only fight doubles of your current character so much before it starts to become irritating. I beat Sinestro as Good Green Lantern, only for Yellow Hal to show up immediately after, Green Hal makes the comment "so you ditched green and went yellow" and my first thought was "so, Sinestro again?".

A bizarre element of this game is the clash system. I still do not know what exactly triggers it but the effects are as follows. You and your opponent bet part or your entire special meter. If you tie, nothing happens, if you lose, your opponent is healed and you take bonus damage, if you win, you heal some of your meter and your opponent takes damage. It feels like a tacky cheap little add on that can be pulled out if you are getting beat bad.

Unfortunately, I do not know how to trigger it, so it is usually just my opponent doing it, to pro-long the fight. This gets especially annoying when even if you fought really well and your about to win a round, the tables can turn around very quickly.

That aside, this is a great game, no doubt. One of the best fighting games since Street Fighter II.

Review:


Following on the success and the heels of the X-Men Legends franchise came this. Done by nearly the same team and with the same publisher, this game has much in common with that aforementioned franchise. However, the roster of characters is significantly different. Although there are still a few X-Men to choose, it expands the roster to include many heroes from Marvel Lore such as Captain America, Spider-Man, the Hulk and more as available choices.

As mentioned, this game uses the same mechanics that worked very well in the X-Men Legends franchise; four characters take on various missions and will earn treasure and rewards. However, the skill trees seem a bit more streamlined when compared to the two prior games. 

Nicely, each hero still has four or five different costumes and unlike XML, each outfit provides its own unique benefits to the character wearing it. The skills and abilities are also very finely tuned in this game.

Unfortunately, the story line gets more than a little long-winded. It tries very hard to tie the many disparate characters together, even though they may not have necessarily be related or even met necessarily in the comic books. Thiers nothing wrong with that as they are all part of the same universe, the problem lies in the fact that it becomes hard to follow and very convoluted. 

You will jump from the Avengers Tower, to hanging out with Dr. Strange in the sorcerer sanctum, to journeying through Asgard, an underwater level that I do not understand, and more. Though hardcore MARVEL fans will appreciate this for what it is, it also means that the average audience can easily get lost or lose track of what exactly is going on, as the settings change quite rapidly and seemingly for little reason, making the story overall feel less defined and a bit disjointed.

Still it is an average game in the same vein of the hugely popular X-MEN LEGENDS formula and can be a tremendous amount of fun.

This was the final game in the MARVEL ACTION RPG series. Unfortunately, it became dumbed down to the point of its own obliteration. 

Each hero has exactly four powers, three standard and one ultimate, and one alternate costume. Considering all the choices and the depth that was present in X-Men Legends and even in this games direct prequel, this is very uncomfortable. 

A very different team that handled XML and the previous entry did this game. The design team even came out and admitted that a lot of this was because they felt to much time in the previous games was spent in menus. Unfortunately id gladly take more time in menus and have the level of depth I had in this games predecessors, then a quick pick which lacks sufficient freedom or variety.

Also on the list of problems is the storyline. Based on the Marvel Civil War comic books, at a certain point in the game your story diverges and your asked to choose sides, either Iron-Man or Captain America. Choosing a side limits your hero selection for two or three missions. The problem is these missions play out the same regardless of which side you picked or the characters in your party, making this choice largely unimportant, epically since you will gain full roster back soon enough anyways.

Like its predecessor, it attempts to expand the scope by taping the breadth of the Marvel comic-book franchise, allowing many new faces to show up as playable characters. Newcomers include Green Goblin or Venom and more. Unfortunately because of the limitations on both costuming, and overall skill trees in this game, none of them really get the chance to be to as exciting as they could be.

Review:


This is another game I first played when I was very young. It is another game by Apogee. I did not realize it as a kid, but it does have some distinctive features for a platformer.

The premise goes that young 8-year-old Johnny Dash has had his poodle become kidnapped by the evil Count Chuck. Count Chuck has been kidnapping pets from all over the globe, and it is up to you and your trusty slingshot to rescue all of them, and defeat him and his generals.

Do not let the cutesy idea of the game fool you, this is an insanely difficult game, even on the easiest setting. 

As mention above, it is Halloween themed. Level designs are inspired, and you will go through things such as graveyards, dungeons, even a haunted house or two. Along the way, you can gather candy to increase your score, hearts to increase your health, and special limited ammunition types for your slingshot.

Your slingshot can aim diagonally up left or right, or in a small arc directly in front of you, or an even smaller arc when in a prone position. Finding the optimal aim is often critical to hitting targets or switches. There are four different power-ups for your slingshot. A tri shot that shoots three normal bullets at once, a boulder that does massive damage, and explodes into a few regular shots if it hits the right surface. There is also heat seeking rockets, and a powerful fireball to use. All of these have extremely limited ammunition though, and so it is up to the player to gather and use them judiciously, especially since if you exit a level whatever power up you had is removed. 

Enemies show a little variation but are very same. Still though thanks to its theme, you will encounter floating skulls with glowing red eyes, skeletons, zombies, rock golems and more. Some of them walk back and forth, others have boomerang like projectiles they will throw at you, but they all feel about the same. Aside from boss enemies, the regular enemies are usually quite weak, and not really a challenge once you recognize their patterns. They are more there to distract you from noticing the hazards and pitfalls, and do serve to enrich and develop the game themes.

Fun fact, enemy gibs are the same graphics from Bio Menace. Not relevant to anything, just thought I would point it out.

The real danger I had while playing comes from hazards, which there are plenty. Boiling cauldrons, sharp walls/ceilings, spears and more are all omnipresent. Johnny has some problems with his pathing as well; he tends to go bouncing off solid corners of objects like he was snapped like a rubber band, to the to many times being forced into a crawling position that goes very slowly. When he is running, he does not seem to run all that fast. I talk a bit more about this later on; but the problem is it gives the static defenses of a level an unfair superiority, more so then other platformers because of the deficiency built into the player character. 

The game is split into three chapters; a condensed version of the first episode was available for shareware. Getting the full game meant access to the full first episode as well as the second two.

It is overall a fun game but it does have a few missteps. Johnny does not seem to run and jump as smoothly as he should for a platformer. Jumping becomes very aggravating and often involves you being in an exact right spot, or you will just miss the jump many times. You also do not jump very high, making accuracy all the more important. Power ups also are a bit on the sparsely placed side as well. 

It does have value checking out, especially if you are platformer nut, or just want to play something Halloween themed.

Review:


This was another giant leap foreword for ID software. Featuring fully 3-D rendered graphics. 

This game is atypical for a shooter. It is very dark, gruesome acutally. Much darker then Doom ever was. Doom was intended to be a horror game as well, but it had so many bright colors and richly decorated textures, I never quite felt it. Here is quite another story.

The terror is real.



The game takes its inspiration from the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. Specifically, the mythos of Cithulu. 


I do get a little annoyed with the humanoid monsters. They did not feel fully as convincing as they should,, ending up looking odd, and disjointed. Maybe that’s the point to. Since it really only applies to two out of a otherwise decent roster its semantics.


The other monsters are incredibly convincing. Sometimes you will face off against a beast that little more than teeth and claws called a fiend, but no eyes or mouth. Boy can they jump. 

The weapons are likewise designed to be more in line with the overall horror theme then. 

You have the traditional shotgun, though this type reminds me of something one would find in a scary movie then the omnipresent military version found in other games. There are nail guns, even a few explosives to liven things up. There is also an extremely crude energy weapon called the Thunderbolt.


The colors are much muted, and a tad lame. I get it it’s the theme and I am not saying a bunch of bright colors would have helped. You can only walk by that same blood smeared wall or muddy bridge so many times before it starts to get to you. I have marked it down on this area, only because the mute colors don’t give me the same elation as vibrant ones. This being said, the game was noteworthy at the time for having an incredible amount of polygons in its graphics. 


All in all, very unique, and stands alone. It takes an established formula and goes in an special direction. Considered one of the best shooters of all time and I have to agree.

However, it is titled Quake II, but an interesting thing is it is not a direct sequel to the previous Quake game. 

The story goes that this title was originally going to be the launch pad for a different franchise. However, they decided to use the name Quake II as a placeholder, intending to rename it later. Well they found out they could not use many of the names they intended and then never got to rename it, thus this became Quake II.

This is a radical departure from the first quake. It is closer to DOOM in its overall feel.

Unlike its predecessor, this is a more mainstream shooter. Though it retains some of the weapons of the previous title in the series, they are more uniformly in origin. Likewise, the new weapons added in are more in line with Sci-Fi movies. 


The games story involves an invasion of the planet Stroggos. The Stroggos are a cybernetic race bent on conquering Earth. To beat them to the punch, Earth has launched a preemptive strike to disable them. Very few soldiers end up landing on Stroggos though, and you are the only one to be able to do anything. 

This was my first multiplayer shooter. I used to play it on gamespy, capture the flag with grapple hooks was my favorite.

Review:

This game is divided into segments, both 3rd person perspective behind or above your ship and first person where you are in the cockpit.

This is a on the rail shooter, as popular with many arcade games. Thus, you can move a little bit but are very much restricted to following a preset path. This however does not translate well to the home PC. The problem with this method, while it might work well for a standup arcade, PC users are unable to maneuver to evade fire, or avoid crashing into the walls, or even the vertical ceiling. It gets incredibly frustrating because you have no ability to set your own path, and most your attempts to make maneuvers will often be overridden by the AI rail path. 

In other words, you might try to go left, but since you are on a preset course, your ship will not match your maneuver. You take excessively much damage from contacts, considering you are unable to avoid enemy fire effectively, or even the wall. You slightly regenerate health if you can avoid being hit, but it does not ever match up to the amount of damage you will receive.

The story very loosely follows the plot of Star Wars: A New Hope movie, with elements of The Empire Strikes Back and a few training missions thrown in to fully flesh out the game.

The graphics in this game are fair, without exactly being bland. The gameplay however is very repetitive, and as mentioned above, limiting.

Overall, I would say this game is average. I can see where they were coming from, and it might have worked well as a 25 cents arcade game, but as a Spaceship Simulator, it is very much lacking.

Solar Winds is a little known title developed by STONE interactive and published by Epic Megagames. It definitely takes most of its inspiration from Star Trek and Star Wars and sci-fi in general. In this game, you step in to the role of Jake Stone, a bounty hunter, who becomes a key instrument, in a fight to save the universe.

It seems as though an highly advanced alien species has kidnapped and then subsequently re-deposited many different life-forms into various solar systems in there dominion. Once there they conduct various zoological experiments, and observe each race. 

Secret agents are placed within each races ruling body, to prevent development of technologies, which would reveal this discovery, and to hold back each races progress, eventually pushing dominant species in each solar system to eventual war and destruction, thus preserving their secret. Each solar system cluster is also encased by a force field, which destroys any vessel attempting to cross the barrier. The inhabitants of each of these solar clusters remain largely ignorant of all this.

The humans in this galaxy seem a bit more advanced than where we were on Earth in 1991, able to build a large number of intra-system space ships, complete with your obligatory sci-fi staples of sensors, shields, transporters, lasers and more. Your ship even sports "missiles" which look suspiciously like photon torpedoes of Star Trek fame. They also have established a solar government and manage police the solar system with so called "robot ships".

I love this game; it was one of my favorites growing up. It was just so cool to be able to fly around in 256 color VGA and interact with spaceships and planets. It also was one of the few games I had at the time that let you fly off in different directions, and go exploring, rather than be locked into one specific direction.  

I guess I never realized, this game does have a lot wrong with it though, and in retrospect, it wears thin fast.

The primary problem is lack of things to do. Early on, you acquire a device known as an Energy-Band converter; it gives your ship power and allows it to upgrade itself. What is the best, only source of energy? A starship explosion. I would often load my brothers saved game and always wondered why he went on killing sprees, and there was no ships left in the galaxy, there is literally nothing else to do in the game. 

Every mission you are given feeds into the overreaching plot of the narrative. Once completed, the mission giver has nothing else to talk to you about, so you may just engage them and kill them, with no consequences.

There are no true side missions. Actual side activities are extremely limited, especially considering the literal large amount of space between each one. You can fly around the solar system, and while it is fun reading the scan reports, they only wrote them for the starting solar system. As in only in first solar system, in part one will you gain detailed reports on ships or stellar objects. 

In the other solar systems, you will only get the name of the object scanned and that is it. Also disappointing is very few of objects actually interactive to you as well, making the majority just pretty objects in the background. You also may encounter a few pre-placed secondary events, but their conversations do nothing but reiterate plot points. The majority of ships just attack you and will have no other interaction possible.

This to me comes off as lazy. 

Part II is even more limited, stuck on a narrow lane path to the end game. Few if any ships or objects populate the solar systems you visit. You receive missions by mission givers again, climbing up the chain, until you are in a position where you are able to save the universe. There are no diversions, no scan reports to hunt down. Some I have met claim they like Part 2 better, claiming it to be larger.

This however is just an illusion brought about by the game's mechanics, when it is actually roughly the same size if not slightly smaller than Part 1.

The other issue is the glitches and bugs, which there are many. Some of these have been fixed by the time you start Part II, but not all of them. There is a great many bugs when it comes to the weapons and combat. 

One bug was that laser bolts has a chance to ignore shields. This is not an actual game mechanic; literally, the bug just decides to ignore shields sometimes. There is the missile bug, where the missile does not fully leave the screen when it should, being stuck on the border. Thus, you can literally ram the stuck missile into other ships for some cheap kills. 

Speaking of cheapness, I do not know if this is a bug, but traveling at a certain sub-light speed and bearing, will cause enemy laser shots to build up. Shots are meant to disappear after leaving the screen, but if you do this right, they will keep pace with you. The enemy will keep firing, adding to the amount of bolts in the air. Sometimes it is possible to fling these into other enemies, other times and more often, they tend to hit you, all at once. 

There is the bug with hyperdrive that everyone knows about, whereby you can increase your speed exponentitional just by playing with the slider. How about the bug where images are stuck on your screen, only clearing when you change your view or open a menu?

Looking back, I feel as though this was a great concept, but a wasted opportunity. They had some great ideas, but is severely lacking in terms of realization. I really cannot explain why there is just so little to do, especially considering everything is distanced so far apart and the game does give you free travel. Things are made a little better once you acquire the hyper-drive, but again this only speed up your travel times, to do almost nothing, seems somewhat counter-redundant.

The graphics are quite good for its time, but obviously fall flat to the modern gamer. 

The sounds are excellent with the SoundBlaster, very nice explosion and weapon sounds. I also like the music; it is very sci-fi evocative, which this game is meant to be. 

Part 1 was released as shareware and has the full episode; Part 2 was acquired by registering. Part I left on such a weird and unique cliffhanger; it remained an unsolved mystery of mine for years. I finally got Part II in late 1999.

I like Part I much more then Part II. Part I is much more detailed, has slightly more depth to it, and the story overall has better direction. Part 2 is not a bad game but I felt let down by its story and again the lack of things to do.

Review:

Star Reach is a unique title. It was released in Europe under the title Star Confederation, but the games are identical in every regard. This is on the list, on par with Dominus, an early strategy game, with some unique things I have not found in other titles.

Some missions are single player, for the purposes of training. Others feature face offs between two and three other opponents. The game has six races. Each race is what you might expect, humans, robots, alien lizard people, knock off Klingons, and more. Each race gameplay is identical however. There are no new units depending on what side you take. There is no special advantage to picking one race over the other; the only difference is the voice/image that pops in your HUD to give you updates.

The story is unique for each mission, and the campaign is not ordered in any logical way. There is no overall plot or narrative, simply defeat your enemies and  accomplish the objectives of each scenario, anyway you can.

The gameplay is unique for an RTS, in that it is mostly arcade like in style. You decide before each mission whether you will be administrate from a flagship or a phantom. 

A flagship has limited fuel, and will explode if it goes too far without refueling. It also costs resources to replace. The main advantage of the flagship is being able to engage enemies personally, and perform escort duty for freighters or to aide your fleet’s group assaults. A phantom on the other hand, will never run out of fuel, cannot be destroyed, but also cannot attack. Most players opt to use the faster phantom, as the flagship can be hard to maintain, and a phantoms movements are not hampered by fuel, therefore, more precise. 

After you settle that choice, you will find yourself thrust into a solar system, where you control one or more planets. Usually your objectives lie in conquering all the planets in the system, and eliminating your opponents. Each planet may be developed to have strong industry values, strong in mining, strong in agriculture and other important economic values. 

Resources generated by a planet may be shipped to another planet under your control via freighters. It is important to protect your supply lines, any resources aboard a freighter will be lost if the freighter itself is destroyed.

There is nine military units to be used. From light fighters to provide additional laser fire, to orbital defensive satellites that help ward off enemy invasions, to troop transports for colonization and conquering planets. The coolest one I found though is the pirate ship, which as the name suggests, allows you to take control of enemy ships.

Either the game may be played by two players via modem connection or in the hot seat, sharing a keyboard, or, ideally, one player uses the keyboard and the other a joystick. This does split the screen though and my brother and I tried for a while to make this work, but eventually decided it was best played solo.

What really sets it apart from other RTS's is the arcade style action. There is not much else to say. The game is average, it is not that it is bad but it is not overwhelmingly good either. 

Sci-Fi junkies may enjoy it more for its setting and it is fun flying around to different planets for awhile, but its definitely less then engaging in the long run.

Review: 

This game accounts your life as a solider in John Connor’s Tech Com Resistance Force in 2029. From the on-set, you and your team manage to capture a prototype exoskeletal suit designed and produced by the machines. Why they would produce such a thing, I do not know. It then makes you the ultimate ace in the hole, as you become Connor’s right hand man engaging in many missions, in a battle to save the future. If you have not guessed already, this game is based on the Future War as alluded to in the 1984 movie “The Terminator”.

This game is not a full first person shooter as WOLF-3D would be a few years later. Rather you move around pseudo 3-D environments that are really a combination of 2-D screens, layered in grid form upon each other. You navigate in the four compass directions. It should be noted though that enemies are also able to follow you through screen transitions.

Upon successfully completing missions, the resistance will reward you with upgrades to your suit. Many different weapon systems and defensive systems are added to your repertoire throughout the course of the game. I found the lasers to be the most useful, but there is also a few different types of grenade launchers and also a few different types of missile launchers to round out everything. You also gain various utility accessories as well, such as a microcomputer that speeds up your repair protocols, an advanced battlefield sensor, which is invaluable when dealing with infiltrator class terminators, you even eventually get a deflector shield that absorbs some damage.

Your suit only has six hard points with which to place equipment, so it does take some time to figure out the optimal configuration for each mission.

Enemies in this game are average. It is not that there is not enough of them, but they do not seem to have as much variety as they should. You will encounter numerous machines built by Skynet, from standard T-800 Terminator models, to more advanced things, such as Eradicator robots, which are larger than tanks, or Hunter-Killers, highly maneuverable airborne flyers. Eventually you may encounter Terminators in disguise, which can steal that ever-crucial first shot from you.

Unique, is this games actual mission flow. It is possible to resign missions if you find them too hard, only for the game to trigger another mission. Depending on whether you are winning or losing the next mission presented will often times be different. Eventually you will stumble on a critical mission and if you abort that, you will lose the game.

It is the awesome part of this game and games period, as I have not seen many games who have had the care to indoctrinate multiple campaign branches, and in fact trigger new, different missions even if a mission is failed. Even StarCraft, though this capability was built into the engine, it was never utilized in any official product.

This game later received an expansion pack, Operation Scour, which includes much more difficult missions, and moves the setting to give you missions set in Washington DC rather than Los Angeles. As the name implies this is a scouring campaign, intended to clean up and eradicate the last remnants of Skynet, who in the first campaign you dealt crippling blows. There are three new enemies but sadly no new equipment or weapons.

The game was re-released on to CD-ROM, which includes both mission campaigns, new SoundBlaster music, and actual recorded voiceovers for the characters in the mission briefings to speak to you.

Well this game is good, decently above average. I will not say it is the best of the best, but it is most defiantly not a poor attempt either.

Review:


This is an interesting entry. Many credit it as the first Real Time Strategy game. It draws most of its inspiration and style on the earlier RTS, Dune 2. I played the demo version a lot as a child, and was quickly entranced, being a fantasy nerd. It lacks the polish of later games or the options but this does not make it a bad game. I always liked being able to both build cities and destroy them, or commanding armies into action and developing strategies and tactics. 

If there is one fatal flaw in this game, it is that your cities, perhaps a limitation of the game engine, well your cities are very hard to build, also you lack the ability to move your resources. 

As in you can only have one fixed drop off point, which is preset before the match even begins. This isn’t bad early on, but mid to late game it’s no fun to send your workers the entire length of the map just to keep collecting. This also by necessity means you will only build one city per match, though some maps are large enough you would want to be able to expand and or build a second city. 

That aside, for the first game in the series it is by no means terrible, just slightly lacking.

The sequel to WarCraft. I received this game when it was still 60$ as a birthday gift. It introduced three front warfare (ground/naval/air). The graphics are much better and incredible when compared to its predecessor. Perhaps this ranks so highly for me, was the map editor it included (no way starting a lifelong fascination with making custom levels for well-known games). It is one of the first level creation program I ever used, and I still have a hobby of making a level in it now and then, if only for kicks and giggles. The game does have the same flaw as its predecessor in that the two factions are almost identical except for sounds, graphics and of course spells. It however does correct the fundamental flaw from the last game in that city planning is easier, and you can in fact have multiple cities. 

The humor is endearing, exploding farm animals, and annoyed comments by clicking a single unit to many times. The map design is also improved this time around and feels much more natural.

Review:


The editor is truly a master piece of RTS engineering. However their are some things that do drag it down in terms of single player and or ladder matches.

The first is the storyline. As a kid, after I finished War2, and its expansion, one of my first forays as a writer, was to compose a Warcraft fan fiction. Continuing the story of where Beyond the Dark Portal left off. I did not get War3 in 2001, or even 2003, I had to wait until 2007. Although I did enjoy some parts of it, particularly the dialogue between Uther and Arthas, I can’t say I enjoyed this games story as much as some others.

Its one thing to use clichés, it’s another thing to rip almost the entire story from one of your other games, and unoriginality leaves me somewhat cold. The only high point of it was during the Undead Campaign in ROC, where you are just destroying all the good guys, and what the game does well, is it really makes you feel like a villain during this segment. 

Unfortunately, the next two campaigns return to ripping off the StarCraft story and become riddled with so many clichés. 

I know everyone was expecting this to be the perfect meld between action RPG and RTS, however it falls short their as well, mainly because the heroes are not properly balanced, at least in stock war3. The community has made many custom maps to even things out, but as I have mentioned elsewhere it is not the player’s responsibility to ensure this.

I did not expect it to be a perfect meld and I do in fact enjoy picking heroes to lead my armies, it opens up a few new dimensions in the strategy. 

Also new are the status effects, which add new layers to the module. A unit can be slowed or sped up, can be stunned, burned and more. Some heal spells might heal less but have a fast cast, while a stronger healing spell takes longer to see the effects.

The one problem with this method is they made the stun effect so strong, and other abilities while they look cool, are not on the same level. Thus its a fatal flaw that if I pick stun for my abilities I can win quite often, where if I want to experiment I feel penalized.


This being said, I am still active on battle.net now and then, let me know if you ever want to do a match, custom or ladder. I know we will have fun.

Those who know me well know I am an avid video game enthusiast. Wolf-3D was something I played growing up. Thiers many who would condone it, for the violence, or the Nazi style themes contained within, but then they do not have to play it. 

Thiers not too much to say about this that has not been covered before by countless other reviewers or websites. I like the level design, I like picking up boxes of gold to increase my score. If their is one bad thing about this game, it is the lack of diverse weapons or options found in later shooters, but then again PCs of the early 90s were not of the same rigor they are today. 

This game, Blake Stone, and a few others, belong to a category of games that are very art deco and I appreciate nearly everything, including the pretty panels and the wallpaper.

This game is a strong contender for the TTP Best Game award.

Fans of good, action based RPGs unfortunately, had limited choices a few console generations ago. Eventually PC users gained Diablo, but consoles still failed to capture the allure of the true hack and slash role-playing game.

Enter X-Men Legends, an isometric RPG based on the Marvel comic book of the same name but not set in any particular branch of the universe. Instead of picking a class, you will begin with a character and unlock more as time goes on. You also can have a maximum of four people in your party at any time, controlled either by AI or by hot seat couch play. 

The great thing about it is the camera is very accommodating and the screen does not become split, allowing for some very coordinated team actions. There is combos, double combos, triple and multi-combos to discover, which provide rewards upon successful execution.

No disrespect intended, but this game borrows a lot from Diablo, in terms of how the bulk of the gameplay works out. Unlike Diablo, the inventory system is much simpler. Although it contains unique items and prefix/suffix style database of items, as does Diablo, you only have three equipable slots. The game also is not as predisposed to the loot explosions as in Diablo, though there are some exceptions.

The skills while none of them looks dull on screen also have simpler arcs in terms of how they are related to another. In other words while other RPGs tends to have deeper and more thought when planning out where to spend your skill points, here it seems more straightforward.

Not that any of the skills appearance or perform bad, and it’s always fun giving Cyclops a new trick he can do with his beams, or unlocking a new sword slash move for Nightcrawler.

This game includes a special skirmish mode, where you can create your own battles, unlocking more options and gaining a full range of options once the main storyline is complete. There is also special missions called "Danger Room" missions which when completed unlock a special hidden character.

This game is very well crafted, the only real moan I have is that the story must always proceed forwards. Thus their no replaying earlier areas, and considering that the full roster of characters does not become available until about 80% of the way through the game, it is more limiting then it needs to be.

Still though, a nice game, and its sequel is even better.

This game introduces waypoints, much like Diablo II. As its predecessor, it does replicate the Diablo formula of success quite well, complete with unique items, quest rewards, many different skill options, as well as your ever-prevalent prefix/suffix database of inventory items. 

This game features upgraded graphics over its predecessor and is much better looking.

The skills system has been upgraded, a minor overhaul done to it as well. Have no fear, they are only expanded upon and made to be much deeper, with many skills providing synergies and other bonuses to their respective character. They are still relatively straightforward and easy to pick up.

A much-deserved talking point is this particular skill system, which gives many of the characters a lot of tricks and traps to play with. Some of said powers may not exactly be canonical to the X-Men comics’ lore, but it is all based on who the character is and their expected abilities, so it gives a lot of depth to each characters playing style. I especially like Cyclops setting up turret sentries that periodically emit his trademark eye beam.

As the previous game, instead of selecting a class, you will instead choose a party of up to four characters. Notably this game has a slightly different roster than its predecessor, regulating some of the party members from the previous game into NPC roles, and dropping some others entirely. This was done to allow pairing up with Magneto and his factions of The Brotherhood and The Acolytes. There are three secret hidden heroes to be unlocked that may be used as well. All told, the selection is stronger, because in also taping Magneto's Crew, many dynamically different abilities may be combined together. This also allows for stunning new combos and team-ups.

Another upgrade to the team system is that you now can gain certain advantages by mixing and matching. For example putting Juggernaut, Magneto, Scarlet Witch, Toad in the same party will unlock the "Brotherhood of Evil" bonus, whereas putting Cyclops, Storm, Magneto and Iceman in the same party activates the "Old School" bonus. There are many other team combos as well. 

As the last game, there is many alternative costumes for each individual character. Matching certain costumes with the whole team will confer some certain bonuses. Even without the bonus, it’s a lot of fun to have access to so many different iterations of these characters, players are able to pick what their favorite incarnation is and have no detrimental effect on said characters skills/abilities or gameplay value.


The inventory system received a nice benefit in now each individual character has a signature unique weapon or accessory that may be unlocked under certain circumstances and then only usable by said character. 

As in the previous game, you are tasked with completing a number of quests and objectives, to progress into the next act. Nicely though, unlike the first game is you may re-visit previous areas, which makes grinding up the levels much more enjoyable, and able to re-visit previously conquered areas as desired.

There are three hidden characters to unlock, each one is treated as a fully fleshed out additional character, rather than just a novelty and is fully worth the time and the effort to unlock.


Go find them.

Death Rally is a top down racing game made by GT Interactive. As per the name, killing your competitors is considered an acceptable way to win races.

Races award more money and points in the standings depending on the difficulty chosen. This also affects the drivers who sign up for the races. 

The game is fun for a while.

In addition to your standard vehicle upgrades, you can also purchase special options from the black market. Rocket Fuel to replace your regular Nitro, sabotage the best driver in the race, mines that explode quite violently and knock cars back, front bumper mounted spikes tear through enemy vehicles.

There are 10 different vehicles to be chosen, each one improving upon the last.

Street Fighter II is one of the best one on one fighting games ever made. It was so successful it spawned many clones. This is one such entry. I remember being so excited for it, just looking at adverts in gaming magazines. 

The game cartridge itself has a beautiful rendering of the Thunder Megazord elbow slamming Lord Zedd. This game came out for Super NES in September 1995, in the very beginning of MMPR Season 3.  

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was close to the end of its run, slowly being phased out for the upcoming Nintendo 64; it really shows in this game unfortunately.

Anyone who reads my other writings regularly knows that I am a huge fan of the earliest years of the PR franchise. I even was dedicated and devout through the spin-off of ZEO. Unfortunately, the tie in games had left much to be desired. You can only blame so much on the limitations of the technology of the time.

This is a two-player fighting game, as mentioned above, and similar to Street Fighter. Uniquely, unlike prior PR games, the starring role is given to the Rangers giant robotic war machines called Zords. Sadly, the game is only based off only the ones that were utilized in season 3 of the show, so do not expect an appearance from the original Megazord or Dragonzord. 

There is also "story-mode" which restricts you to the pick either the Thunder Megazord or the Mega Tigerzord, and you must fight all the other fighters. In two-player mode, you can select your fighter from four different Megazords or four different villains. 

Interesting that the Ninja Megazord and Shogun Megazord are selectable and present, as both had yet to be revealed in the ongoing television show at the point of this game's release.

The sounds are iffy at best. The music is midi instrumentals from many of the songs from the show. These sound atrocious coming out of the SNES speakers. 

There are those who like this game, and find its concepts to be novel. I guess my problem is I had already played much better games of this very same type, before and after.

There are tons of imitators in the video game world. Everyone jealous of someone else’s success. This is an example of this. Welcome to Blachthorne.


In Blackthorne you play a guy, who’s attempting to do something. Along the way you will fight orcs and have to solve puzzles.


This game borrows a lot from the iconic Prince of Persia, and I mean a lot. From the running and the timed jumping. Also in the fighting, which instead of a sword, you are given a shotgun, and must dodge from enemy gun blasts. The mechanics feel identical to Prince of Persia sword fights though and I could swear I was playing that game at these times during these sequences.

There are some new ideas not present in Persia, such as light bridges and floating platforms, that you will use to progress through a levels maze sometimes. There’s also mines, to be used for blowing up both breakable walls and against certain enemies. Sometimes you will need to save your mines to progress in the level and thus if you use to many on enemies you will be screwed.

Review:

Tyrian is another mostly unnoticed underrated title. Its general theme is a top down space scroller, common for many games, particularly arcade cabinets. 

You can play Tyrian however in any number of ways, from a dumbed down arcade mode where all you have to worry about is lives and score, to a full story mode complete with ship customization/personalization.

There are hundreds of gadgets and weapons for your ship as well as about twenty different ship classes to select. You use your money between the levels to buy these things. If that is not enough, there is also a Ship Editor that allows you to create your own customized ship from scratch, based around equipment you have unlocked previously, with your own custom graphics. 

The system in this game for upgrades is also unique, as it does not penalize the player for trying new weapons and different loadouts. This is worth a lot of praise. They all have different variety but keep you at the same relative strength level based on the level of the funds you have invested in your spaceship. It also means when playing in arcade mode you do not have to worry about picking up a different weapon.

The enemies range from the standard staples of this genre to very sophisticated and unique. Five episodes may be played in any order, and may be replayed repeatedly.

The graphics are very decent, though purposely looking cartoony in a few places. Still it is very colorful and a visual treat.

The story puts you in the role of Trent Hawkins, an ace pilot bent on saving his home world Tyrian, from the grips of an evil corporation. It has many twists and turns and a very satisfying ending.

It should be noted though that there are a few mini games hidden as well as Super Arcade Modes. Super Arcade Mode differentiates from the standard arcade in the menu, by use of hidden ship codes typed in manually. Each hidden ship has unique properties and special weapons that are not found in any of the standard modes, which in turn allows for replay ability.

It is a fun game and the only area that it really loses a point or two, is it can get very repetitive, and all the levels are played in the same manner, blow up everything on the screen, pickup treasure, start the next level.

This game uses the same engine as Crystal Caves, and the two games are nearly identical. In a world where PC gamers did not have much to choose from in what to play, this succeeded, if barely. 

To that end it is almost an identical game to Crystal Caves. It does have new enemies, who are truly new and not just borrowed from CC. However it contains all the same elements, run, jump, collect keys, avoid hazards. Moving platforms, elevators and mazes are all back. As are your three precious health points per level attempt.

I have scored this slightly higher then CC, because the level design is stronger, the enemies are better and smarter, and the graphics although still cartoony have been given a slight upgrade. It has a few minor tweaks to the formula as well to break up some of the mundane. Overall, the mechanics are slightly stronger than CC while retaining the same feel.

As mentioned above though, it is mostly a clone of CC, so non uniqueness drags down what otherwise would've made it score higher.

This is another one of those titles, which was mainly played, because of lack of other options.

I am a big fan of LOST the TV show. My favorite season is season 5. I love the intrigue, the action, and the mystery. Unfortunately, all these were left out of the game. 

The game includes some strange puzzle elements. One of these is figuring out odd math problems, to reroute circuits and power. This would not be a bad thing, if it were not used ten times. Would it not make more sense to have the puzzle based around in game events, the one's math skills? I did not do these I had to have my brother figure them out and do them for me.

Anyone who watches the show, knows that LOST is set on an island, with large amounts of curiosities and areas that would be amazing to see up close and to investigate. Regrettably, you cannot travel to any of these in free foam, you must wait until it’s involved in the story, and even then, you are not offered a full range of exploratory options. A missed opportunity if there ever was one.

This game follows a protagonist named Elliot, who was on flight 815, and has his own frame story while the main story of LOST plays out all around him. I understand that they were bound to the canonicity of the TV show, and the video game was an extraneous venture once LOST proved so popular. However I did not know that Sawyer had a shop, or that people could trade him twenty mangos, in order to get a 40$ credit stake, usable for other survival items. Good thing virtual characters do not need to eat.

The game includes a bizarre save system. This save system was the last nail in the coffin for me. I said oh wait I want to go check something else out. Therefore, I reloaded my game, only to have my entire inventory of items completely blanked out.

I turned it off at this point, and never went back. It's really that bad.

Well this is another FPS shooter released during my childhood. It is a bit of an obscure title as it was released a week before and in the shadow of DOOM. Most of my comments about Wolf-3D can be echoed here.

The game plays much like one would expect from an upgraded Wolf-3D, including a variety of weapons and more interactive environments and options then its earlier predecessor.

There are many enemies, and many different types to.

It’s hard to quantify which one I like more; they both are highly colorful art deco games and should be given equal praise. I may lean towards liking this slightly more then Wolf, if only for its Sci-Fi based theme and I love the futuristic weapons available to the player.

Review:

This is the little known follow up to Aliens of Gold. It is entertaining, and fans of Wolf, SOD or AOG will feel at home. Speaking of SOD it has some commonalities with that game, as the 6 episode structure is again replaced with a continuous 21 level game. Their are also 5 secret levels, bringing the total up to 26. The level design is also fairly strong, despite the game's numerous shortcomings.

I am sad to say, that I do not appreciate this one as much as AOG. I do have a few reasons for this. Number one is that it boasts of having new enemies. However if you play AOG you’ll realize that they act and look almost the same to the ones from AOG. Simply doing a palette shift, or changing the colors but giving them the same uniform does not qualify to me as a new enemy, but this may just be my opinion. On that same subject, the game loses points to, in that while I can understand reusing some sounds from the previous game in the series, the so called "new" enemies make the EXACT same sounds as their predecessors from AOG did. 

Most of the guns received an updated look when shown in the players hand, perhaps to make them seem more realistic and less cartoony. This brings me to another minor complaint, which may not matter to some is, my favorite gun, the orange and blue rifle from AOG, although still present, is also given a complete palette shift, the only one this was done to, the others appearance was merely updated. It functions the same, it only looks different in the players hand, inventory or lying on the ground. The odd thing though, is enemies who have it, still use its appearance from AOG, as if almost to taunt you because it will never look that way when you use it. I am not quite sure why this was done, but I did not care for it.

My final complaint is also the change in the keycard system. AOG allowed you to take multiple paths and you could in theory take a keycard from one level and use it on another level, leading to some interesting alternative playthroughs. In this game you are stuck on a linear path and must use the keycards at the time the developers expected you to and you thus cannot be as creative as you could in the aforementioned playthroughs of AOG

The game does include a few new nice features, such as gun bobbing, destructible effects and two new weapons. A majority of the items and wallpaper was upgraded and they look more realistic. However, this is not enough to save it.

Consider, Hexen is an indirect sequel to Heretic, set in the same universe. They use the same engine, have about the same level quality of graphics. Yet Hexen brought new concepts to the table and features completely new graphics and enemies, items, weapons and sounds. Thus although similar, they are hardly replicas. 

This game however, it scores so low for me, because of the supreme lack of originality.

Taking a note from one of the chief competitors of the time, Nintendo and the Mario Franchise, this is a platform, run and jump game. You are also able to shoot enemies, and double jump via your pogo stick. 

You have to avoid contact with any enemy or hazard, any slight bump and you will lose a life and have to restart the level.

The story chronicles young Billy Blaze AKA Commander Keen, who is on a quest to stop the Vorticons from invading the galaxy. An inside note is it is suggested that he is the grandson of BJ Blazkowitcz, aka the hero of the Wolfenstein franchise. 

He can climb poles and shoot enemies with his blaster in order to incapacitate them. He also will collect treasure items to earn new lives and increase his score.

Some love the sounds, the bleeps and bops of the PC Speaker, to me they just irritate me.

The game is divided into three episodes, each with unique mission objectives that run the course of said episode.

This game begins with our young hero Billy Blaze being sent to his room after throwing a temper tantrum. He falls asleep, only to be kidnapped by amorphous vegetables. They reveal the mean King Boobus has been kidnapping children all over the globe and it is up to Keen to defeat him, and save the world once again.

This game has some major departures from the previous game in the series, Invasion of the Vorticons. Some of that might be because this game was published by Softdisk, rather than Apogee, which handled all other Keen games. Gone is the pogo stick, so no high jumps here. Gone to is your Blaster, no more zapping enemies. Instead, you collect pellets called "Flower Power" which temporally stun enemies.

This game uses an upgraded engine than its predecessor, allowing slanted platforms and the ability to slide down firefighter’s poles. It also has better graphics, sounds and music. 

This is my least favorite Keen Game however, mostly because a lack of the aforementioned staples of the Blaster and the Pogo. The game ends up just feeling awkward without them. 

It also feels kind of like a weird conundrum, in lacking those two things it makes the gameplay fall below average, yet all the sounds, graphics and level design has drastically improved since Invasion of the Vorticons.

An interesting note here is that this was the prototype for the Goodbye Galaxy game. However, it was released and published by Softdisk roughly around the time the Goodbye Galaxy shareware, and if we go by the numbers, fans dub this entry Keen 3.5.

Keen is blasting back! This time he is off to a faraway galaxy to stop an alien race called the Shikadi from destroying the universe. 

This being a Keen game, your back to jumping hurdles, collecting treasures and avoiding monsters. The Pogo Stick and the Blaster make welcome returns.

The treasure system has been upgraded a bit, allowing more of a chance to earn precious lives and ammunition.

I've grouped both parts of Goodbye Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter here, because they use the same engine, the graphics are largely the same, the treasure items collected are just pallet swaps and do the same things in each game, thus are not truly new items. None of the mechanics is any different and all three are essentially the same game.

It should be brought up though, that the enemies DO actually change, from Goodbye Galaxy Part 1/Part 2, and Aliens Ate My Babysitter, all three sport new looking enemies with different coding. The level designs themselves are also changed from game to game.

My final note, Goodbye Galaxy: Part 1, is my favorite Keen game of all time.

This is a run and jump platformer. The protagonist in this game Mylo Steamwitz, who seeks to collect enough crystals, to be able to afford his own farm. He is hampered by enemies and hazards some that can kill instantly, others take one of his three health points upon contact. He must last long enough to collect all crystals in the level and then make his way to the exit.

The story is kiddie and all the graphics are cartoony. The gameplay is also ridiculously hard at times. It is quite the contrast when you think about the overall premise.

Not that the puzzles are ever to difficult, but there is no way to restore your health and many enemies and hazards are immune to your shots, so you can spend hours trying to get past tricky jumps.

It is an ok game for a little bit, but it ends up being very below average even when compared to even fellow contemporary platformers of the time. If you love platformers, you might enjoy it a bit more than the average gamer, but their are much better options out there. 

What really drags it down is just the low amount of health and with no way to restore it. It is very repetitive to and lacks genuine variety; meanwhile almost every level is very large and may take many tries to get through.

Review:

Blizzard thanks to the record sales of their earlier title, WarCraft 2, was an expanding its empire and ascending to its place as one of the world’s top video game publishers. They decided to try making an Action/RPG hybrid, which this game is, one of the best done in that said genre.

The gameplay is simple and easy to pick up, and has a huge amount of depth to it that not many seem to realize and may overwhelm some. Yet whether you know every fact about every item and enemy in this game or you are just down to kill a few packs of monsters with some friends, the game abides.


The graphics, although not bad, and not exactly terrible, might offend the modern eye. The time this game was released though, they were considered awesome.


Players have the option to pick between three generic fantasy classes, which all have their own strengths and weaknesses, and your mission is simple, hunt down Diablo and slay him. Each one is a specialist; the Warrior excels at Melee combat, the Rogue at ranged attacks, the Sorcerer at magic.


Going back and playing this all these years later, the loading screens, which were once annoying, load in seconds on modern day computers. Still it was funny to me the first few times they popped up.


I am sure some hardcore religious people will dislike this game, because of the nature of the story it tells. It is set in a fantasy gothic environment with devils and demons of incredible power are coming to threaten the world.

Elves, orcs, trolls, dwarves and other WarCraft races and staples are not present in this franchise. This is because the game is more about the gothic horror then it is about High Fantasy. This was an aesthetic choice by the developers. They wanted further differentiate from the WarCraft franchise. Despite their absence, you will find the game does not need them.

The Hellfire Expansion pack adds two new dungeons, three new character classes, new quests, new spells and new inventory items. It was not done by Blizzard but rather developed by Sierra Online. Unfortunately, it did not catch on with the mainstream Diablo audience, the main source owing to problems with that it was patched, and the patch for some reason removed multiplayer on battle.net. 

The two new dungeons received many complaints, although they feature new monsters, there is very little interactivity within the dungeons themselves. Hellfire is not a bad expansion but since it was done by a different company, it has a different flow to it.

Notable is this was released in the gaming era where there was many cut content and or hidden features including unfinished abilities and incomplete missions. Most of which are activated and fully realized once the Hellfire expansion is installed, although you can use a backdoor method to access the bulk of these goodies from your original Diablo install as well. 

I like this prototype material and, I think that is cool, and definitely awesome that this was included on everyone’s copy of Diablo.

If you felt the first Diablo was good, just wanted more to do consider this is as your wish granted. This game is more expanded in all areas and yet plays more or less functionally the same.

There are five classes, each class has 30 skills which may be upgraded upon leveling up. Certain skills are locked by level requirements, and separated by tiers, this in turn is to make the abilities you do pick more immersive, and allow for each class to have strong replay ability.

As in the first game, there is many different inventory items to find, and there is both new types of items, and new classifications for said items. I suspect this is perhaps the biggest selling point for me, as there is so many possible different combinations and so much treasure to be had; this makes this game intensely fun.

Story wise the game is also strong split into four amazing acts. The first and fourth acts are direct continuations of Diablo I story, where Acts two and three serve to take you deeper into the World of Sanctuary and expand upon it.

The expansion, adds two new character classes, hundreds of new inventory items, class specific inventory items, new crafting options, new crafting components, and a brand new full act of quests and missions to conclude the storyline.

This game from the very beginning is great. So many diverse options and ideas, it can be overwhelming at times, but then, take a breath, appreciate it for what it is. 

Another aspect I would like to comment on is that this game from initial design phases was geared to multiplayer. Sure, there is still a few trolls, but for the most part the community is very friendly and charitable, which is refreshing.


There is some selfishness sure, the best policy I've found is to find a friend or two, who you can help another in finding items you desire, and just sit back, and enjoy all the spoils of war.

This game is unlike any other I've ever found. It begins normal enough to most strategy games. Your city comes under attack, and you must defend yourself. Unlike other strategies though, you do not have the option of striking their main base, your options are to defend your city or let them advance. One might become intimidated, as there is about ten different factions, all with different goals and aspirations for attacking you. Nicely to, is every new game these switch and randomize, which increases playability. 

The only flaw with this system is the only way to learn spells, is to capture a enemy mage, and then hope he is friendly enough to you to reveal a new spell and he will only ever reveal one of the ingredients it needs. This is also randomized with each new game, both the creatures overall friendliness and the ingredients to use.

(I have however found a workaround to this flaw, see my papers on Game play Strategies for more info on that issue)

However you have a slew of different options with which to protect yourself. You have a large spell book, which only increases as the game goes on. You can assemble traps of your own design and then use them to slow and deter progress of the advancing enemy. You also have a number of different armies yourself that you can dispatch on a soldier by solider basis to engage the evil force. You can capture enemy forces and use them against their former comrades. You can get lucky, capture a leader of a faction, and convince him to leave. You can arrive via your flying chariot and engage enemies personally, using fireballs and punches. Your options are limitless.

This game is will always be one of my favorites, the strategy is very unique. I rank it so highly for both its uniqueness and the innovative options, I haven't found many other strategies that allow you to have so much simultaneously going on. The game manual states you are a Demi-God and have fallen under attack by rivals. Being able to have my soldiers engage a squad, while I lay down traps or mix up spells, I definitely do in fact feel like a true leader.

It would be really nice, with all the revitalizing of old hats my generation seems so fond of doing, if this was given a modern day follow up.

This is a side scrolling shooter/platformer for DOS. You have a few inventory items, mostly just keys, but the double-jump boots and the grapple hook will help you get around. 

There is only four or five different enemy types; the game relies instead on solid level design. The problem with overusing so many of the same graphics though, it often becomes hard to find your way.

A note on the graphics, a lot of them were borrowed from some other games, so it is hard to give an accurate score reading on them. However, I do enjoy the scrolling backgrounds, especially the floating cities in episode two, or the future skyline in episode three.

The story is the generic mad scientist wants to take over the world plot, but does have a few interesting twists. 

Despite me ranking the graphics as low, it is mostly comparing them to this game's own sequel. They do not look bad, but they are not particularly great either in this title.

For the first game in the series, it is not bad and a quite a bit of entertainment value.

Expanded Scope! That the word about this one. It plays very similar to its predecessor but with more options. All the enemies are new, which is very refreshing. There are now four unique weapons, the fourth one also doubles as a jump pack.

I played the demo version of this for a long time in the early 90s, it would only be in about 2001 or 2002 I managed to acquire the full version. It does not disappoint, it plays as everything its predecessor tried for but looks and feels much better. 


The power ups are largely the same as its predecessor but are all given updated looks. They also are far less common, which serves to make this game more challenging. 

The graphics are all improved 200%, I also think I like this iteration of Duke Nukem's portrait the best out of any Duke Nukem game. 

This game really reminds me of why I have such vivid memories of my childhood.

If there is a gripe, it is only that the level design, like its predecessor, you have no option to view the full map, and although the graphics are very pretty, they all look very similar and you can often run into dead ends or returning to places you've already been just trying to find the exit.

Duke Nukem 3D is the sequel to Duke Nukem II. Although you would never quite realize it, as many things have changed. Most different is the schema, we have transitioned from side scrolling platform with some light shooting, to full blown first person shooter, complete with a large arsenal of both weapons and items. The story is not anything unique to me, aliens invade us, one lone man is all that’s standing in their way.

However, he can fly and he can kick butt. Literally, two of his weapons are kicks. The arsenal is impressive, from your shooter standard staples like the pistol, shotgun and machine gun. Then you have two types of rocket launcher, two bomb weapons best used making in traps, and two special weapons. 

Having so much variety, this is what I feel most shooters should have, if your game is a shooter, and then have a full arsenal. The weapons are fun to use and avoid becoming repetitive or too similar to another. 

Taking an idea from Heretic, this game also incorporates secondary non-weapon items. Sadly, most will come across as boring, and simply serve to protect you from various environmental hazards, and do nothing else. However, it is always fun to fly with the Jetpack.

The game is also littered with cameos and Easter eggs, triggering many quotes and one-liners first heard here. 

I cannot say whether or not if this is one of my favorites, perhaps because I have played so many shooters and while this one is fun and entertaining, it does not stand out to me in the same way others do.  

The BUILD engine at the heart of it is one I keep going back to however, thanks to its power and sophistication.

This game also has quite a number of expansion packs and ports. The most official one was the Plutonia experiment, which adds a new episode, a new regular enemy, a new boss enemy, dozens of new wallpaper and decorations, new Duke Quotes and one new weapon, the microwave expander.

Still I would highly recommend it if you like edgy humor, or shooter games, or both, I am never bored while playing this game.

I read countless articles about this in 1996. I would read countless more. This game was hampered by getting lost in what they call "development-limbo". It was intended to follow up 1996's Duke Nukem 3D, but for assorted reasons, which I will not comment on in here, it was delayed until 2011.

So what can we say? Well Duke's back, ready to kick ass again. Seems the cycloids did not take the hint from the beating he gave them in Duke Nukem 3D, and have launched another invasion. 

This game incorporates a two-weapon swap system, popular with many modern day shooters ever since Halo. I have to say I do not like this trend, especially considering one of the rewards of many of these game's predecessors, is having a full arsenal. Duke could carry 10 weapons in Duke-3D so to me this feels like it is a step back. Likewise, the level design is linear and you are constantly stuck on one specific path as most modern day shooters. One of the reasons those old shooters especially Duke-3D, have such replayability, is you can take different paths to get to the same exit. 

I don't want to complain too much about this one, its a weak game but as it is I'm a big Duke Nukem fan, and a big Gearbox fan. Play it for nostalgia, but don’t get your hopes to high.

Heretic takes place on a world that has been desolated by an evil being known as a Serpent Rider. It is your quest to travel through your ruined planet, collecting weapons and items, to find him and destroy him. 

However you must track him down first and square off with his vast army.

The enemies here are all unique and thankfully, not duplicated in other shooter games. Games always score higher for me the more original they are. That being said, this was the first shooter game to incorporate a secondary inventory system, one for non weapon themed items. 

From wings that allow you to fly, to teleport discs, to invisibility masks, or any other, it seems as though the developers just decided to incorporate what they deemed would be fun to use. This works extremely well, especially since all inventory items are geared to specific situations, and have unique effects, which has the intriguing side effect of strengthening the level design. Not that the level design is bad on its own, but the items open up many new possibilities.

The weapons are also fairly unique for a shooter. Each of the various weapons feels different and is useful in different circumstances. In fact the only weapon that seems cloned is the Necromancer Gauntlets, which behave much like Doom's chainsaw, but it’s no big deal for me. Each weapon is given an alternative, SUPER MODE where upon activating a certain inventory item, your shots behavior are buffed and performance is significantly changed. 

Even those gauntlets, with the SUPER MODE, they can drain health from an enemy and give it to you. On this same point I believe this was the first FPS game to incorporate alternate firing modes for your weapons, even if it needed another item powerup to gain access to them.

Threes nothing I don’t like about this one, go check it out.

This is a two player game that brings new meaning to the term Rockem Sockem Robots. One chooses a pilot, and then chooses a robot. Each robot has a different set of moves and specialized attacks. A pilot will upgrade his or her attributes and robot packages between the rounds. Performing well in a round nets you more money than if you performed poorly.

Most of the robots have largely unique fighting styles, adding a lot of versatility to this title. There are however, a few repeats in some of the special moves unfortunately.

The robots also have drastic different inspirations. The Shadow for example is clearly modeled after a Ninja, and relies on its agility and spamming its special moves, but is quite vulnerable in the end, whereas the Nova is a more military oriented robot, able to hit hard, and take hits, but much slower then one of the smaller robots. 

This game has many hidden features, and gets extreme and crazy, which only adds to the fun. Like most Epic developed games of the time, their is very many hidden features, special gems, and shows a level of depth and quality, that is not often found in the world of gaming today.

My final word, a superb choice.

I played this game for many years in the arcade. Eventually it came released for home consoles. 

This is a two player fighting game. Uniquely, each player selects three characters, and has the ability to swap between them ad infinitum. When a fighter takes enough damage, they are eliminated from the round. The list of available fighters is staggering, incorporating many Marvel and Capcom mainstays and some more obscure characters from both franchises. There are also some new fighters made uniquely for this game. It truly was a stroke of genius to mix the Street Fighter franchise with fighters from the X-Men.

Most of the graphics and fighting moves did not originate solely to this game, but borrowed from many other games, though this plays out much better than it sounds on paper. For example, Wolverine with Metal Claws is directly ripped from X-Men: Children of the Atom for SNES. 

This however in no way impairs their functionality, and all fighters have a nice range of moves and decent variety. In many cases, their moves were also supplemented with new ones in order to fully round out their character, such as Cyclops being able to perform Ryu's dragon punch.

One annoying aspect of the game is you have multiple ultimate moves available to you after a certain amount of time in a fight. There is also "Glamour" moves, which also drain your ultimate charge. Unfortunately, theirs many times when you will want to execute your super charge, only for your fighter to strike a pose for a photograph, or for Wolverine to beat his chest and this drains your charge the same as Iron-Man's proton cannon. This is not a true flaw however, and makes me laugh each time. 

Fans of fighting games or fans of Marvel or Capcom, will love this game. I've played this for a long time, and each time I see at least one new move from these characters that I have not seen them do before.

For this and its large roster of characters, it is one of the most versatile titles I've ever found.

The story picks up loosely where Space Quest 2 left off. It has been an unknown amount of time where you have been in suspended sleep inside your now drifting escape pod. The pod, seen as nothing more than mere trash, is taken aboard a garbage freighter. This in turn triggers the pod to shut down the suspended animation chamber and for you to wake up and begin your journey to escape.

You are now given the identity of Roger Wilco, who it turns out, you always were. No more putting in your own name. This works out pretty good though as it gives the game more freedom to pull fewer punches and put the protagonist in humerous situations.

It is not that the story is written badly, I think it just suffers from bad execution. I played this game for many years before picking it up. It is hard to ascertain why exactly you are doing what you are in this game, and most of the time it feels as if you are traveling the galaxy blind.

Of note this game unlike its predecessors, uses an engine called SCI, this gives in turn expands all of the features of the previous games.

This game has something I have not seen in any other game, the ability to travel between planets, land, and explore the surface. 

The graphics are still hand drawn by Mark Crowe, and are amazing; especially considering he only used about eight different colors.

The humor is still there, however it is still highly sophisticated. I do enjoy the jokes, I like pulling up to the McDonalds, only for the Enterprise to leave as soon as I get there. It does rather remind me of early Frasier seasons, when the jokes were very intellectual. It has its share of slapstick humor as well however, particularly in the many ways to die.

One note I should address, is that many people have said it’s a plot hole, that Roger is ambushed for obtaining a free Labion mating whistle in Space Quest 2. People forget that the company he got it from is Gippazoid, as in, they jip people. 

I will echo a complaint I read about this one many years ago, that the game starts, and ends far too quickly. 

It is in every way superior to its predecessors, and the nice feature of not being bound to just one planet, but the lack of story direction and the lack of things to do on each planet make this mostly a sightseeing adventure.

This game takes place immediately following the conclusion of Space Quest 3. It seems that Vohaul survived by copying his brain patterns onto a CD rom, the CD was then uploaded into the Xenon Supercomputer, where he promptly took revenge on Wilco for his actions in Space Quest II, by burning the planet. Not satisfied and Wilco still unaccounted for he sent two of his enforcers, the Sequel Police back through time to terminate Roger. Roger escapes thanks to a resistance force known as the Time Rippers, who send him to the future with the hopes he can defeat Vohaul again, for the last Time.

This is perhaps my favorite Space Quest game. The humor has always been a part of the franchise, and here it really comes out well. It is much less sophisticated and more mainstream, slapstick and down to earth, but still enjoyable.

This game was released twice, once on floppy disk, and then later, a voiceover CD-rom was released. The voices are all good, and the narrator certainly got really into his role. I really enjoy many of the voices as it turns out.

This game uses another new engine. Gone is the parser interface, replaced with icons. I am mixed on this, on one hand it makes solving puzzles easier, on the other hand, it makes the game lose some of the allure and intelligent thinking required in previous entries.

Space Quest was always a fun series for me, playing much like "Spaceballs: The Video Game" if their ever was one. Unlike other Space Quest games this one is clearly a spoof on Star Trek, but not really much other SCI-FI.

Thiers nothing worse then releasing a sequel 8 months after the first game. Except if your "sequel" is little more then an expansion pack. 

This is Armada II.

Those who know me, know that Armada 1 is one of my favorite games of all time. Unfortunately a lot of the magic was lost in this sequel. Ships for some reason have lost their pathing abilities from the first game, and now fly to minimum range, park and shoot until they are destroyed or they eliminate their target. Gone is the fluid movements in three dimensions of space from the first game. The physics of it seem to be removed, and ships can no longer fly in formation with each other. The game also includes an X/Y axis, presumably to add depth to the strategy, and warp drive but these just came out as a useless feature to me.

The graphics here got retooled, and, the Federation ships look decent. However I can’t say I like what was done. I think the designers took a nod from the A1 modding community and decided to include more details on the ships and stations. However their is something to be said, for overdoing it and they came out worse for the most part, though this may just be my opinion.

The game also tries to expand the horizons’ of the original game, by introducing colonization of planets as well as three new resource types. However one of the things that made A1 such a great game is that harvesting was very simple to setup and then receive a constant stream you just had to worry about your fleet. It’s ok to colonize planets to gain metal or to mine a nebula for Latnium, but again it destroys one of the great staples of the first game, albeit unintentionally. 

Another fatal flaw was that each side is very minimally changed from the first Armada, adding maybe 3-4 new ships. I do not how you can justify having players pay full price, for something they can achieve in A1 via the modding community.

It does include two new factions to use in multiplayer or custom scenarios. The campaigns missions and skirmish maps are also still well designed.

This game is fun for awhile. The goal is simple, fly around, shoot enemies and complete missions, then head to the exit. Rinse & Repeat for every level. 

I've always had a long standing policy not to judge a game too harshly on its graphics. After all the game may be very fun to play, who cares if it only has a few colors. However here enemies look somewhat bland. Some however do look better then others, but it seems hit or miss. The various planets are all decently textured for the time, but in present day some might turn their nose up at the graphics quality.

The various weapons are all unique. It’s hard to try describing every one in the scope of a review, just try them yourself and use the one you like best. My personal favorite is the ION Cannon.

Another issue is it is extremely difficult game; you take a lot of damage, from crashing into walls or the ground, or from enemy shots. This would not be so bad if there was more shield powerups, but these are random drops from enemies or buildings.

A high point is all the secret tunnels and passageways. Go in all tunnels and you will always find a surprise. 

Not that I didn't spend many hours playing this, absolutely worth trying.

Review:


This is one strategy game for the ages. It contains so many different unit types and objects. There is a lot to consider with anything. The attention to detail is impressive. The resource-gathering mechanic is different from other RTS games, in that they are streaming, rather then stockpiled.

I don't really know what really to say about this one. If you like your RTS to have a lot of units or options, this is a good pick. This game is revolutionary to, incorporating many features later strategy games take for granted.

These include destructible terrain, environmental effects, and true 3D pathing for the units. It was the first RTS to incorporate relativistic physics. In terms of the weapons, lasers shoot fast and accurate, homing missiles can be evaded, cannon shells loose velocity and attitude after traveling long distances and more.

If only this had a strong matchmaking community, if only.
