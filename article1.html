<blockquote><span class ="quote">&ldquo;</span>

Since I love video games, I thought I would put together a list of some of the more interesting glitches/gameplay features in many video games. This is only to include cheats as it pertains to certain functions/irregularities, but not intended as a cheat code guide or exploit guide in any event.Rather this is just an exploration of some quirky moments within gaming.
 
Baldur’s Gate
      Something rather simple is the concept governing the charged items. Though some can be used by any character, if used by a character who could normally cast that spell, the spell produced uses their power level to determine the range of effects. For example, a mid-leveled to high-leveled wizard using a wand of magic missile would be able to use the wand to yield additional missiles with each use whereas a fighter would be forever restricted into a single missile.
      In the first version, before the expansion is installed, the invisibility effect will make you invisible to everyone, including plot sensitive encounters. This was later fixed as it could cause players to miss important things.
      It is possible to use summoning spells to form enormous armies. You can disdain the use of other party members and solo most of the game this way. An advanced tactic is to cast all your summons, then cast Sanctuary. The second game and all future releases had summoned creatures reduced to a total of five at any given time, probably due to this very oversight.
      In some versions, if you manage to kill Gorion in the prologue, the protagonist is instantly smite by an unknown means.
      You can attack Gorion and Tethtoril in the prologue. They will retaliate with a unique spell, which seems to be a form of call lightning. This will instantly kill, though. If you have additional party members, they will attack the ones closest to them. Gorion seems to have only one cast of this spell though, and if he fails to kill the protagonist with it for some reason, he will go through his regular spell list, the ones he uses in the scripted conclusion of the prologue, until he runs out of spells. Tethtoril on the other hand will be able to cast this instant death spell infinity times, though notably only the first 2-3 casts he makes are ranged. The rest are a melee version of it. (Enhanced Edition)

WarCraft II
      In Mission #13 of the Human Campaign, if you are quick enough to turn on God-Mode you will save Lothar. However, it is impossible to achieve victory while Lothar is still alive. You can destroy all enemy forces but if Lothar is alive, the mission will not end, forcing you yourself to execute him in any manner you choose. His hero unit also does no damage during this mission. Most curiously, he also has an unusual behavior for an Ally AI in that he cannot be claimed or taken control by the player.
      Death Coil is an AOE spell, so your aim can be a little off and still have desired effects.
      You can also cast Death Coil on critters.
      You can also cast Raise Dead on critter corpses.
      In certain versions of WarCraft II, you could raise Knight/Ogre corpses repeatedly, until it decayed to bones. I used to think this was intentional, as Knights have the horse corpse as well, and Ogres are larger, thus more bones, more skeletons. Later versions fixed it so you may only cast it once, after a corpse has sufficiently decayed.
      If you send multiple workers into a mine with one bag of gold left, one worker will grab the bag, the rest will disappear with the mine as it is removed from the game world.
      Turning on god mode will also increase the damage output of all units. Most game objects will be destroyed in a single hit. Gold mines and other more durable objects will take some time.
      God Mode does not in fact confer invulnerability; rather it raises the armor value of all the players units so they take 000.8 damage per hit. Not sure on the number there, but it is proven as you can use heal spells if you drop 1-3 health points.
      If a mapmaker has two Rescue Active Allies, the Rescue Active A.I.’s will fight and compete with another for unknown reasons.
      Casting Invisibility on a bomber instantly detonates it as will casting Unholy Armor on one. It is unclear if this was intentional or an oversight.
      Invisibility only renders the object invisible to other human players; AI players will still see it.

WarCraft III
      In Mission #8 of the second campaign, the player gets first access to Banshees. In addition to their support spells, they may also exchange themselves for an enemy unit. This may done with a High Elf worker in the same mission with the following results.
      High Elf worker has a unique technology tree; although comparable to a Human, it is not exact, able to build High Elf Guard towers, High Elf Barracks, High Elf Farms and High Elf Town Halls/Castles. This build list is also notably not the same one that the Elves use in the second campaign of the expansion.
      The High Elf Barracks will not complete its construction for unidentified reasons.
      They also may build a Hero Altar that can curiously train Human heroes but not Elven ones.
      This altar also inexplicably has the ability to train heroes indefinitely until the supply limit is reached, which itself is a radical departure from how heroes work in War3 Campaigns or Melee Matches.

Total Annihilation
      All objects have a Self-Destruction move. Hitting CRTL-D starts a 5-second timer. It can likewise be canceled up to and during the last second. The uses of this are limited by only your imagination.
      You can use your aerial lift unit (Atlas/Valkyrie) to lift/kidnap enemy units as well.

Diablo/Diablo Hellfire
      If you move 3-4 paces off an object, then click the object, and then click an item on your belt, if timed correctly, the object will duplicate. This was patched out of the game in later versions.
      It is possible for your character to perish anywhere at any time. If you are wearing health-boosting equipment, and your base health rating drops to negative values, you can suicide anywhere in the game simply by switching around your gear. Even in town. Fixed in the sequel.
      The game contains unused prototype content, three additional character classes and about a half dozen or so new spells. Most of these become active once Hellfire is installed but in case you do not have access to Hellfire, you can activate them by using the following method.
       Add to the command line, this will enable aforementioned content.

StarCraft: Brood War
      Older versions of the StarCraft CD contain two missions cut from the Terran Campaign. These can be activated using a MPQ extractor.
      It was intended that flying buildings would crush units upon landing. However, this was left out of the final game, except for Siege Tanks converting from battle modes, and oddly, Interceptors.
      Irradiate spell can target friendly mechanical units, irradiate will not harm them, but can be used as shield in this way.
      Spells are able to target critters. Mind controlling a critter sees the critter retain its AI patterns, which is unusual. You can use the Zerg parasite on a critter to gain a benign spy.
      SCVs can repair Terran Mechanical Unit hallucinations created by a High Templar.
      In Mission 3 of Episode 6, it is possible to destroy the Dropship that comes for the SCV, thus retaining you the SCV for the mission. Since it cannot build like a normal SCV theirs not much real use of doing this but it is still neat though.

Wolfenstein 3-D/Spear of Destiny
      In the earliest shareware version released to the public, there was a No-Clip cheat code. This allows the famous phasing through solid objects such as walls/sprites. This was removed and subsequently later returned in Spear of Destiny.
      At low health (below 10%) you may eat the decorative blood and skeletons sprites for a 1% gain.
      If you turn on God-Mode and then exit to the demo screen, each demo will now play in a weird alternate take mode. Because the character is not killed, he will continue going through the level. However, he will eventually strafe the same 4-5 floor tiles repeatedly, as though he is trying to figure out how to proceed but cannot quite grasp it. Sadly, Spear of Destiny will end the demos after a pre-set time.
      In addition, on the demo screen, by using the level warp cheat, you can record new demos.
      Using the level exit code on floor 9 of any episode will start you on the first floor of the following episode. The floor indicator in the HUD will also be identified sequentially. Thus episode 2 floor 1 would read as floor 11. This is fixed in the GOG version. (Wolfenstein 3-D Only)
      If while making a map, you plant the titular Spear somewhere where the player can grab it, if they do so, they will be transported to the Angel of Death floor. (Spear of Destiny Only)

Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold & Planet Strike
      When 11% or lower in health you may drink decorative water sprites. A hold over from Wolf-3D.
      You can replicate the “God Demo” glitch from Wolf-3D here as well. Unfortunately, like Spear of Destiny before, BS demos end sooner rather than later to display the score screen.
      If you damage a Sector Patrol, they will run across health items to heal themselves. They also, surprisingly enough are the only enemy who seems run out of ammunition. If this happens, they will run through the level looking for ammo/weapon to reload their gun. If they are damaged during this point and NOT killed, they will be given one bullet by an unknown means to fire back at you.

Duke Nukem 3-D
      Shrink Rays bounce of mirrors and teleporter surfaces. Though pretty obvious, it is used to access some secret areas.
      Teleporters will also transport all weapon fire through them.
      In certain versions, if you have 49 pipe bombs, and find a box of said weapon, Duke will take one out of the box, but the box will remain intact. This was patched out as it could ultimately lead to an unlimited supply of pipe bombs.
      Using Duke’s detonator will also detonate any other individual pipe bombs in the level, even those out of view, preplaced or used in traps.
      In E3M1 you will come to a room with 4 looping teleporters. It is then possible to have any weapon fire pass through the loop endlessly when aimed correctly.
      Using Duke’s kick weapon, or the alternate kick (via the ~ button), you may open some doors, even if they are locked.
      God mode will resurrect Duke. It also remains on if you switch to the hardest difficulty mode, which normally precludes cheats. It also allows endless flight with the jetpack. If this is used to resurrect from third person perspective, Duke will also repeat the first few frames of his non-gibed death animation until he takes another state change (jumping, going underwater, etc.).
      Enemies may be frozen, and re-frozen. They drop anything they would have upon regular death. If ammunition allows, a player may spam-freeze an enemy for multiple drops.

Star Trek: Starfleet Academy
      Each of the instructors (Kirk/Sulu/Rotherot/Chekov) has specific generic videos that play often when the player makes the same common decision. Firing on a Starbase is one sure way to trigger the “disappointed” speech.
      A merciful player will notice that many objects in the single player campaign may be rendered inert simply by hitting it with enough phasers set to “disable” mode. This triggers some alternative dialogues from your crew, though it does not affect any other part of the game, including the mission. Overall score, endings, etc. will remain unaffected. During custom skirmishes, the object will simply repair itself.
      The Miranda Class is notable to have a complete carnage model for it; most other game objects have very limited carnage models or none at all. This feature would later be expanded and made much more important in Klingon Academy.
      Typing “KNAT ATTACK” in Mission #16 while in the home system will cause the Starbase to disappear, and a squad of six fighters to spawn. These fighters are named after members of the development and production team.
      During player-customized skirmishes, (Quick Battle), your weapons do no damage to the Starbase and it cannot be destroyed. It will however raise its shields and retaliate. If you fire on the Starbase, then warp out to the skirmish, return, the Starbase will not react to further attacks by you. The Starbase will also react violently to you if you dumb enough to crash into it.
      Some single player campaign missions have severe glitches, which among other things will continue successfully, even if doing something outlandish like destroying an important object or skipping part of the assigned cruise.
      During the bonus mission, you may freely travel. This is the only mission when I have seen this as able to occur. You must time this right though, as you must warp out after you scan the derelict ship but BEFORE you receive the distress call. Once warped out you may warp freely around to any sector listed on the HELM computer. I have however not discovered anything notable in doing this. This was patched out of the version of the game available on STEAM.
Star Trek: Klingon Academy
      Let us start light and easy, certain ships (most notably the Klingon BOP), have moving mechanical parts, which move to different angles depending on whether or not your weapons are powered and ready or if they are in unpowered mode.
      No Shakurian ship ever flies alone, simply use the communications menu to launch and give orders to your fighters. Your fighters behave as additional wingmen. Order them to “Form up” will return them to your shuttle bay.
      The ships library is fun to read through. There are however two topics that stand out above all other entries. One is an empty article on the Excelsior II, which seems to be a reference to the Enterprise-B. Presumably, this was not given more than a  vague shout out, not included because of the licensing issue (Generations, officially being part of the TNG movie brand, even if it does include characters from TOS), though it would have been appropriate for the setting regardless. Another such article refers to a Leipzig Class Freighter, which though given a wireframe model, is not in the final game.
      More an oddity then a full on glitch, sometimes objects will eject their warp core, if they have one. I suspect this was an intended feature but was not fully developed and implemented. Still though, it was left in, in an incomplete state. Sometimes ships will eject their warp core as soon as their engines come under attack, scarcer, they can do it randomly. The core does nothing, though it might detonate, more than likely if it is fired on. Its detonation causes damage about equal to the standard object explosion. The ejections process instantly eliminates the objects warp capability as well as warp power generation, though the physical engines themselves may remain intact. It is in the end, a rare event.
      A single, scripted warp core ejection event that is guaranteed to happen most often is the mission in which you launch a raid on the Sol System. Simply cripple the YAMATO class battle cruiser prototype, which spawns near Saturn.
      If performing an in-system warp jump and then toggle the gunnery chair, then proceeds to hit 2, 6, 3 the following will happen. All functions disabled during normal in system warp jumps come back online (Weapons, Attitude Thrusters, Etc.). Your ship will begin to accelerate exponentially faster and faster, following the general heading of the last targeted warp. This allows for the tunneling through partial solid objects such as Stars, Black Holes etc. However, any tunneling more than likely cause’s severe damage your ship, even with shields and hull ratings completely boosted. Objects with large widths and fully solid objects are likely to prove fatal. This also will eventually land you in “null-space” where there is no escape, as you cannot gain a sensor lock and plot a new warp jump. To cancel this affect, simply pick a game object, and plot a new warp to it. This peculiar thing was dubbed “Transwarp” by those in the multiplayer community.
      This one is an Easter Egg, but one few know about. After completing a Quick Battle scenario, you may travel into about a dozen or so different solar systems. I am not sure but it seems as though what follows is determined by ratios. Enter the solar system to find it empty is most common. Sometimes you will get random hostile AI encounters. There is also a small chance you will have a confrontation with an Easter Egg Ship.

Star Trek: Armada
      You may board and capture cloaked objects if you are able to spot them.
      If you attack an object that is meant to survive the scenario, the most you will be able to do is partially cripple it. The game will literally drop new crew and heal said object rapidly which each successive hit that would have destroyed it under normal circumstances.

Star Trek: Elite Force
      The Borg adapt to all weapons in the game except for one. Not all but many weapons also cause small extra AOE damage from just the concentrated force, which for lack of a better term I have called Concussive Damage, which itself seems to be a holdover from earlier ID tech games. The same property allows for the famous Rocket-Jump. Concussive Damage will never be adapted to by the Borg. Thus if you aim your weapons adjacent but not directly at a Borg Soldier who has adapted to said weapon previously, you can still kill them with the Concussive Damage. This also allows the player to destroy otherwise indestructible game objects such as the EMH.
      By hitting the tilde (~) you can bring up the console, which should be familiar to anyone who has played any of the ID-Tech games or their derivatives. There is a great many console commands, which are documented all over the web as cheat codes, just search the web. In lieu of wasting time, space, and listing every single one, in this article we will simply talk about some of the more interesting aspects of them.
      Most ID-Tech common codes work (God Mode, No-Clip, No-Target, All Weapons, etc.)
      You can place any weapon in the game into your hand, even if it is an enemy exclusive. This includes weapons used by Turrets, and the Borg Weapon among others. Enemy exclusive weapons may not be recharged however. There are also several prototype weapons and inventory items found within the console. These are partially complete but did not make the final cut of the game and have mixed functionality.
      You can spawn any character/creature in the game. It spawns with a beam in animation at position of your crosshair though so aim well or they may end up merging with a wall. (See next)
      You can switch your team flag to a specific one as used by the game’s enemies. This allows you to attack your former Starfleet friends without losing the game instantly, and having your new spawned team back you up. The result is you can create your own pitched battles, albeit the positioning is a bit tricky.

Star Trek: A Final Unity
      If you fiddle with the Engineering Console to much you can cause a Core Ejection.
      Worse yet, you can also induce a Warp Core Breach, killing everyone.
      Some fun arises if you set a course for a long trip away and then engage at warp one. The crew will then offer idle chatter, much of it referencing Season 6 and Season 7 TNG episodes.

Xenon 2
      It is still possible to die with God Mode active if you allow the screen to scroll forward while stuck on a solid object. Likewise, erratic movement into solid barriers will also sometimes cause death, regardless of God Mode.
      It is possible in some levels, to reverse all the way back to previous levels. This is easiest to accomplish in Level 2, to reverse engines all the way to the start of Level 1. While the pre-set enemies, money pickups, power ups, etc., do not respawn, certain enemy generators, such as the caterpillar cocoons will still generate their respective enemy at regular intervals.

Tyrian/Tyrian 2000
      There is a great many cheat codes and other twiddles, but in this article we will be only talking about unique ships.
      A unique ship is a code, usually granted at the end of a game episode, which allows you to fly a unique ship during a specialized playthrough, which has exclusive features.
      There is nine unique ships. Each has one to three special secret weapons and many of the games regular weapons and gadgets are altered to match the theme of said ship.
      By hitting escape on the difficulty screen and going back to the episode select screen, you may retain the unique ship for any game mode, even Full Game Mode. All special secret weapons are removed while playing in other modes however.
      The Ship Editor utility unlocks more features as you play the game. It will unlock any weapons/gadgets you complete the final mission of an episode with, among other things.

Solar Winds
      It is possible, though very difficult to destroy the alien ship at the start of Episode 1. This will eliminate the second encounter you may have with it during the later game. This is only worth mentioning because the game is notorious for ignoring most of its own continuity.
      If your shields are raised while cloaked, other ships will also raise theirs for nameless reasons.
      If you fire on an enemy and are very close, your shots will ignore their shields. This works both ways so be warned. Ships can and will often run into their own fire.
      By frolicking with the Engine Power slider while in Hyperdrive will cause your ship to gain speed, just do not take away all Engine Power or you will come to a hard stop.
      More common late in the game, though can occur at other points, when shooting a missile, it will sometimes be stuck on the corner of the screen. You can then ram said corner of the screen into targets to kill them easily.
      Traveling too far in any, one direction causes your spacecraft to explode. Usually around the 2900 coordinate mark or so. However if you save before you suffer this fate, you can bypass where you thought you could go. For example if you note you exploded at 2700, save your game at 2650, and you will go further. You will still explode at a certain point, simply keep making notations and saving. This is probably a design aesthetic to keep players from wandering to far, despite the game appearing to be open-ended.
      By using this tact, you can indeed travel to all those distant stars you see on the long-range scan screen; however, there is nothing at any of them.
      This also allows you to complete the game by doing no missions, talk about wow. As in 0, w0wzars!

Quake 1
      In every level, there are many super-secret areas, buttons/switches, hidden compartments and assorted tricks and traps that only become realized when the game is launches in multiplayer mode.
      You can use the no clip code in the shareware version to access the transporter pads leading to the full version episodes. However, this will cause the game to crash, as it goes through the loading sequence to load the level but of course fails to find it.
      When completing an episode you are returned to the hub. Completed episodes are then walled off. You can however use no clip to bypass these barriers and play through the episode again.

Descent/Descent II
      Descent II introduced us to the guided missile. It is a remote control missile which you guide using your regular flight controls. When a missile approaches optimal range, you can change it into a regular homing missile by hitting the fire key once more.
      More interestingly, find a wide-open area with limited obstructions. Using the controls, and by gradually adjusting the attitude, you may place these missiles into low orbits.
      Their exists an Easter egg weapon, which is only possible to obtain by using the all weapons cheat. Type in the code, then select your laser. Hit the key again and you will cycle your weapon to the special boss robots ricocheting laser.
